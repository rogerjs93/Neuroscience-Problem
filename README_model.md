# Neuroscience Problem: Dopamine and Happiness

This repository contains a Python script that simulates several models of how dopamine and other factors might affect a person's happiness. These models are purely hypothetical and are intended for illustrative purposes only.

## Models

The script includes the following models:

1. **Simple Model**: Happiness is directly proportional to the amount of dopamine.
2. **Complex Model**: Happiness is proportional to the square root of the amount of dopamine, modulated by the individual's sensitivity to dopamine.
3. **Complex Model with External Stimulus**: The effect of an external stimulus on dopamine release is considered.
4. **Complex Model with Tolerance**: Over time, the brain can become less responsive to dopamine, requiring more of it to achieve the same level of happiness.
5. **Complex Model with Serotonin**: Both dopamine and serotonin contribute to the level of happiness, with dopamine's effect being modulated by external stimuli and tolerance, and serotonin's effect being more straightforward.

## Usage

To run the script, you will need Python installed on your machine. You can run the script from the command line as follows:

```bash
python models.py
