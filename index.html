        <h1>Neuroscience Problem: Dopamine and Happiness</h1>
        <p>This page presents a hypothetical neuroscience problem related to hormones, specifically dopamine. We assume a new technology that allows us to control the release of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is known to play a significant role in reward-motivated behavior.</p>
        <h2>Simple Model</h2>
        <p>First, we used a simple linear model: Happiness = 0.5 * Dopamine.</p>

        <h2>Complex Model</h2>
        <p>Then, we added complexity to our model by considering the individual's sensitivity to dopamine. The new model is: Happiness = s * sqrt(Dopamine), where 's' is the sensitivity to dopamine and 'sqrt' represents the square root function. This model suggests that the increase in happiness for each additional unit of dopamine released diminishes as the total amount of dopamine increases.</p>

        <h2>Complex Model with External Stimulus</h2>
        <p>We considered the effect of an external stimulus on dopamine release. The new model is: Happiness = s * sqrt(Dopamine + e), where 'e' represents the external stimulus. This model suggests that both the dopamine release and external stimuli contribute to the level of happiness.</p>
